This version differs from version 2 by:
-Master changed to have the 1st const >= instead of =
-Pricing changed to :
	* set the variable y,z, and v of VNF which will never be selected (are not of the same type of the service requested functions) to 0
	* allow the pricing to start and finish the schedule between startSchedule and delta
